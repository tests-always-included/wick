# Updates all packages on the system except kernel updates.
#
# For RedHat and CentOS this will skip kernel updates because that may
# unintentionally break the guest additions when the machine is under
# VirtualBox or another virtualization system.
#
# When guest additions are installed and the kernel is updated, it appears
# that one must also reboot and then recompile the guest additions against
# the updated headers in order for things to work.  To avoid that problem
# we just skip the kernel packages.
#
# Examples
#
#   wickFormula update-packages
#
# Returns nothing.
